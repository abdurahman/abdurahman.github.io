  infoParaOne: "My past experience with programming started in high school when I learned the Visual Basic language. After doing that program for all 4 years of my student life in high school, I realized that I enjoyed learning and understanding how programming languages worked and how I can build programs out of them and because of this interest, I have decided to join George Brown College and their program in Computer Programming and Analysis to further my understanding and my studies in this career path.",

  infoParaTwo: "Along the way, I have struggled in terms of learning new concepts and understanding how to implement them in my day to day work but with the help of friends and the Internet, I was able to overcome these situations time and time again. Another struggle I had during my college life is the lack of motivation to continue in my studies for the final two semesters. The pandemic in general took a toll on me and so I did not feel motivated to learn anything and I felt burnt out. To overcome this, I made sure I talked to friends and family about my daily life as well as exercised whether it be at home with weights or outside doing a simple thing like walking.",

  infoParaThree: "For the future, I hope to be in a job working as a software developer either in a well known company or in a start up company building programs and also working on side projects within my professional career.  To achieve this, I will work on many skills such as learn new programming languages as well as people skills like communication and teamwork in order to be able to talk to colleagues in the workspace.",

  // About/Bio Section --------------
  aboutParaOne:
    "I am currently a software development student at George Brown College currently in the Computer Programming and Analysis program. I am in my final semester. I hope to gain a job in the industry after graduation and I feel confident enough to go into the industry and start applying for jobs.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "I have learned many of the current programming languages such as Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, ASP.NET and Swift. With these technologies, I have designed and developed software applications that met the technical requirements and functionality of the clients. Some examples of projects I have created are that I have made a client notification program using Bootstrap, MySQL, HTML5, CSS and PHP using the MVC model and a flight manager application in C#. I have also created a employee management application using React JS, Spring Boot and MySQL.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "With all of these things in mind, I can also state that I possess good writing as well as verbal skills which helps me state information in an effective manner and also helps me understand and handle complex situations in a orderly fashion. I can also write in detail the documentation of the program that I create so that other developers who look at my program can understand the logic behind the program and to help the user understand the application better with the documentation in hand. Two other skills that I am currently working on are my critical thinking skills and my problem solving skills as this will be necessary for my day to day life as a software engineer with problems that will arise in the workplace that I will need to solve for and to effectively write the code in a clean manner as well. I can also provide key suggestions that will help improve functionality of the application being created. I work well in a team oriented setting and strongly believe in working together to meet client obligations and company goals. I have the ability to work under pressure and meet tight deadlines while maintaining a friendly and positive attitude. ",
